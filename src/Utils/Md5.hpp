 * @brief Simple C++ implementation of the [MD5 Hashing
 * Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5)
 * @details
 * The [MD5 Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) is a
 * hashing algorithm which was designed in 1991 by [Ronal
 * Rivest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rivest).
 *
 * MD5 is one of the most used hashing algorithm there is. Some of its
 * use cases are:
 *  1. Providing checksum for downloaded software
 *  2. Store salted password
 *
 * However MD5 has be know to be cryptographically weak for quite some
 * time, yet it is still widely used. This weakness was exploited by the
 * [Flame Malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_(malware)) in 2012
 *
 * ### Algorithm
 * First of all, all values are expected to be in [little endian]
 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness). This is especially important
 * when using part of the bytestring as an integer.
 *
 * The first step of the algorithm is to pad the message for its length to
 * be a multiple of 64 (bytes). This is done by first adding 0x80 (10000000)
 * and then only zeroes until the last 8 bytes must be filled, where then the
 * 64 bit size of the input will be added
 *
 * Once this is done, the algo breaks down this padded message
 * into 64 bytes chunks. Each chunk is used for one *round*, a round
 * breaks the chunk into 16 blocks of 4 bytes. During these rounds
 * the algorithm will update its 128 bit state (represented by 4 ints: A,B,C,D)
 * For more precisions on these operations please see the [Wikipedia
 * aritcle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Algorithm).
 * The signature given by MD5 is its 128 bit state once all rounds are done.
 * @note This is a simple implementation for a byte string but
 * some implmenetations can work on bytestream, messages of unknown length.
